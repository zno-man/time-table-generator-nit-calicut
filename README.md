finally take the screen shot of the final image after opening it via the browser.                            <br>  
                                                                                                             <br>
                                                                                                             <br> 
for eg:                                                                                                      <br>          
                                                                                                             <br>
to replace the slot " A" with say " subject 1" note that the initial blank space "<blank space>A"            <br>
is necessary to replace only the slot names and not replace the                                              <br>
<a> tags , also be sure to enable this replace option after enabling the MATCH CASE option.                  <br>
