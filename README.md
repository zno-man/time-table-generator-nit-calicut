
download this file , then open it using notepad and replace the slot names using find and replace (ctrl+h) 
finally take the screen shot of the final image after opening it via the browser.


for eg:

to replace the slot " A" with say " subject 1" note that the initial blank space "<blank space>A"
is necessary to replace only the slot names and not replace the 
<a> tags , also be sure to enable this replace option after enabling the MATCH CASE option.

 currently 
  *1*  = A
  *2*  = B
  *3*  = C
  *4*  = D
  *5*  = E
  *6*  = F
  *7*  = G
  *8*  = H
  
  *16* = P 
  *17* = Q
  *18* = R
  *19* = S
  *20* = T 
  *21* = U

(or)
  
 you could just do it in google sheets/excel ðŸ˜‚
